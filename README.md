This Streamlit app explores the challenges of small sample sizes in econometric analysis through interactive visualizations and statistical tools. It covers key issues such as estimation bias, hypothesis testing, statistical power, model selection, and regularization. The app allows users to visualize how sample size affects estimator precision, power, and bias, and includes modules for time series analysis, bootstrap methods, and Bayesian approaches. Users can adjust parameters, run simulations, and compare different econometric models, making it a practical tool for understanding small sample effects in applied econometrics.
